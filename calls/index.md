Call for Participation
=======

Calling all UCSB CS grad students!

We are pleased to announce the first CS Student Research Colloquium!

The goal of this colloquium is to give graduate students of our department an opportunity to give a quick (5-minute long), concise presentation about their research to fellow CS grad students and faculty.
We are now soliciting your participation! The application consists of a short abstract for your 5-minute research presentation (the usage of slides is optional).
We believe this will benefit you in a number of ways:
*Practice in delivering an engaging, understandable, and impactful research pitch to a diverse technical audience
*Development of professional presentation skills
*Detailed feedback on your research pitch from peers and faculty
*More visibility within the department, possibly leading to opportunities for intra-departmental collaboration
*Free food and prizes! (Think of this as a slightly more technical CS coffee hour.)


Application

Applications are due by February 13, 2015, 11:59pm PST.

Slides
-------

Each speaker is allowed to use a maximum of 3 slides during their presentation. Slides MUST be sent to mvigil@cs.ucsb.edu by February 25, 2015, 11:59pm PST. All slides MUST be in Adobe PDF format. We will be presenting slides off of a single machine during the event to maximize the number of speakers that can participate and we appreciate your cooperation towards that effort!
